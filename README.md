# Containerise Build Tool

## About this project

Build tool to containerise cloud applications.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- [Pack CLI (Only if you're using `buildpack` configuration)](https://buildpacks.io/docs/for-platform-operators/how-to/integrate-ci/pack/)

## Setup

## Usage

```bash
  Usage: ctz <filename> <options>

  Options:

    -p, --push           pushes image to specified repository
    -l, --log            logs the standard output
    -h, --help           get detailed usage information
```

## Examples

```bash
  ctz build.yaml
  ctz build.yaml --log
  ctz build.yaml -l
  ctz build.yaml --push
  ctz build.yaml -p --log
```

## Configuration

The following fields are allowed in the YAML file.

|        Field      |      Description                                             |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| *_schema-version* | schema version of the containerise yaml file.                |
| *repository*      | registry where your images/modules will be pushed.           |
| tag               | global tag used for all images/modules.                      |
| before-all        | list of commands to execute before building images/modules.  |
| *modules*         | list of modules.                                             |

### Configuration of modules

There are three ways to configure how to containerise a module:

1. `buildpack`: Cloud Native buildpacks to containerise a module.
    
    Example:
      ```yaml
      modules:
      - name: bookshop-srv
        build-parameters:
          buildpack:
            type: nodejs
            builder: builder-jammy-base
            path: gen/srv
            env:
              BP_NODE_RUN_SCRIPTS: ""
      ```

    **type**: Mention the buildpack(s) (comma-separated if multiple).  
    There are certain keywords which when mentioned in `type` key of buildpack which are parsed as:

    |        Keyword    |      Parsed to                                               |
    |-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
    | *nodejs*          | gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/nodejs                              |
    | *java*            | gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/java                                |
    | *sap-machine*     | gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/sap-machine                         |

    **builder**: Specify the builder type.  
    There are certain keywords which when mentioned in `builder` key of buildpack which are parsed as:

    |     Keyword       |      Parsed to                                               |
    |-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
    | *builder-jammy-base* | paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-base                       |
    | *builder-jammy-full* | paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-full                       |


    **path**: Path of the module to be containerized.
    **env**: Environment variables (key-value pairs).

    `Note:`: `pack` CLI tool is required for this option. 

2. `dockerfile`: Dockerfile provided by the user is used.

    Example:
    ```yaml
    modules:
    - name: bookshop-srv
      build-parameters:
        dockerfile: <path to a docker file>
    ```

3. `commands`: List of commands provided by the user are executed to build the image.

    Example:
    ```yaml
    modules:
    - name: bookshop-srv
      build-parameters:
        commands:
        - command 1
        - command 2
        - command 3
    ```

    `Note`: These commands are executed as is without any validation.
